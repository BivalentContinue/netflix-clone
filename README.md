#[Hosted Using Netlify](https://gifted-varahamihira-34886b.netlify.app/)
-First major app based on Netflix. Followed Karl Hadwens' tutorial.

TODOLIST

1) All animation logic is in components.js [DONE]
2) All user input logic is in the containers.js 
3) All global app state functions are in the pages.js

In order to initialize the project... 
1) Link project on your firebase account
2) Create a 'config.js' file with a the necessary firebase credentials 
3) Ensure the object you create has keys coresponding to the '/db/firebase.prod.js' values.

Seed the database by....

1) Uncommenting contents of 'seed.js' 
2) Uncomment import statement for 'seedDatabase' at the top of the '/db/firebase.prod.js'
3) Save the '/db/firebase.prod.js' file a single time and it should seed your firebase database

*Carefully follow these steps. As live reloading will immediately invoke functions. This can cause your firebase to seed multiple copies seed.js*


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
